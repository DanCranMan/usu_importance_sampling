Purpose: The purpose of the scaffolding method is to decrease the variance the result for a stochastic simulation,
while also generating a definitive lower bound. Also, the method is designed to work with minimal outside input, which
should allow for testing to be performed without major oversight.

How: The scaffolding method works by building off of a predetermined path. 
To do this all states that are known to connect to a path that connects to the target space are placed into a dictionary. 
Using importance sampling the connections rates to states in the dictionary are increased, and then a stochastic simulation 
is performed with new connecting states being added to the dictionary as they are found. 
In theory, this method creates a concise lower bound by branching out into connecting states from an inputted seed path. 
After the scaffolding has finished the result of the simulation should be obtainable by reserving the importance sampling
weights and then calculating the result with the systems correct rates.
